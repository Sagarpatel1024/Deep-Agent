# Deep Agent Project

**Deep Agent** is an intelligent system that can **research, summarize, and organize information automatically**.  
It works like a digital research assistant, capable of searching the web, summarizing content, storing important information, and planning next steps.

## How It Works

Deep Agent is built around **four main components**:

1. **TODO / Task Management** – Keeps track of tasks and subtasks to manage research efficiently.  
2. **File System / Context Storage** – Stores summaries and raw content for easy reference.  
3. **Research / Web Tools** – Performs web searches and summarizes content using GPT-4o-mini.  
4. **Sub-Agent Delegation** – Splits complex tasks among sub-agents for parallel research and faster results.

## Real-Life Example

- A student wants to learn **“Model Context Protocol (MCP)”**.  
- Deep Agent searches multiple web sources, summarizes key information, and stores it in files.  
- If more research is needed, sub-agents continue to search related topics.  
- The student can then read the summaries instead of spending hours searching online.
