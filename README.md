# Deep Agent Project

**Deep Agent** is an intelligent system that can **research, summarize, and organize information automatically**.  
It works like a digital research assistant, capable of searching the web, summarizing content, storing important information, and planning next steps.

## How It Works

1. **Web Search** – The agent searches for information on a topic using the Tavily API.  
2. **Summarization** – Long web pages are summarized using GPT-4o-mini into key points.  
3. **File Storage** – Summaries and raw content are saved for later reference.  
4. **Reflection & Decision** – The agent reflects on the results to decide what to do next.  
5. **Sub-Agent Delegation** – Complex tasks are split among smaller sub-agents for faster research.

## Real-Life Example

- A student wants to learn **“Model Context Protocol (MCP)”**.  
- Deep Agent searches multiple web sources, summarizes key information, and stores it in files.  
- If more research is needed, sub-agents continue to search related topics.  
- The student can then read the summaries instead of spending hours searching online.
